# OpenRCT2 Award Eligibility Plugin

The OpenRCT2 Award Eligibility plugin gives you a detailed breakdown of park awards in OpenRCT2. It displays whether your park currently meets the requirements for each award, including the current value to help you reach meet the requirement.

## Features

- Displays a list of all park awards.
- Shows whether your park is eligible for each award.
- Provides detailed requirements for each award, including which criteria are met and which are not.
- Updates dynamically every second.

## Current Limitations

- **Incomplete Requirements**: Some award eligibility requirements are not fully implemented.
  - **For Most Awards**: It's currently not possible to check which awards are currently active through the plugin API. If and when I'm able to get it added to the API, I'll add new requirements for the affected awards.
  - **Most Disappointing Park Award**: Requirement for "More than half of rides have a satisfaction of 6 or less" is not yet implemented. I don't believe ride satisfaction is available through the plugin API. I'll work on getting it added.
  - **Safest Park Award**: Requirement for "No recent crashes" is not yet implemented. It's possible to see if a ride has ever crashed, but accessing the more complicated recent crashes metric does not appear to be exposed in the plugin API. I'll ask the devs if I just missed or if it can be added.
  - **Best Custom-Designed Rides Award**: Requirement for "At least 6 custom-designed rides" is mostly working, but there's a `hasTrack` flag I don't believe I can access through the plugin API that may or  may not affect the validity of the requirement logic.
- **English-Only**: The plugin currently supports only English. Localization for other languages will be coming when I figure out how to do it.

## References
As a kid, awards in RCT 1 & 2 were an absolute mystery to me. When I saw Marcel Vos's video and Deurklink's guide, it was like solving an ages old mystery. My thanks to them for their work sharing the details for mere mortal and the straight-forward C++ code I referenced constantly.
